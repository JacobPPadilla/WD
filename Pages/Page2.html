			Gary Harris Draft Evaluation

		<div class="body-text">
			Michigan State sophomore guard Gary Harris is a talented player who gets it done on both ends of the floor. Does he fit into Phoenix's plans?

			Evaluation

		<div class="body-text">
			<p>Harris is the best two-way guard in this draft not named Marcus Smart. He's very smart and effective on both ends; a skilled offensive player and a relentless defensive one.</p>

			<p>But his lack of polish or explosion as a penetrator worries me, and I'm not alone. Every year, Sports Illustrated posts evaluations of many draft prospects from a group of anonymous NBA Scouts - a group SI calls Finch. Here's what Finch had to say about Harris:</p>

    		<p>"He can put the ball in the basket, but I would love him to be a better ballhandler and make plays for others guys. He's a good athlete; I don't think he's a special athlete. He can guard better than guys like [Nik] Stauskas and [Doug] McDermott, but he's not nearly in their class as a shooter."</p>

			<p>Harris visited Phoenix for a workout earlier this month, and Suns GM Ryan McDonough said he wasn't worried about Harris' drop in efficiency as a sophomore:</p>

    		<p>"I think he was dealing with some injuries this past year. I think he was banged up from all the intel we've gathered. He's one of the better two-way players in the draft. He certainly shot the ball well out here today and his ability to defend stood out. I don't think it was a matter of him getting overloaded, I think it was a matter of him getting physically worn down and beat up."</p>
