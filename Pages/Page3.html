			Doug McDermott Draft Evaluation	
		</div>
		
		<div class="body-text">
			<p>
				Doug McDermott ended his college career as the NCAA's fifth all-time leading scorer, putting up huge numbers with ridiculous efficiency throughout his four years at Creighton. How much of his game will translate?

			Evaluation

		<div class="twobody-text">
			<p>
				McDermott is a deadly offensive player who can score in a variety of ways from everywhere on the floor. He's a really smart player that will be able to pick up and fit into any system and can get his without demanding the ball be in his hands at all times. He proved himself against NBA competition at the Team USA camp, holding his own and was lauded as the best shooter in a gym full of pros.</p>
			<p>
				He is a very high character player and an incredibly hard-worker. He wowed teams and analysts in interviews and is no stranger to being in front of a microphone (something that I've seen first hand in the three years that I've covered him).
			</p>
			<p>
				If McDermott is put into the right situation, his strengths can be exploited and his weaknesses can be minimized - making him a true weapon.

			Verdict
		</div>
		
		<div class="twobody-text">
			<p>
				McDermott would be tremendous in Hornacek's system as both a three and a small-ball four. His shooting would be deadly paired with Goran Dragic and Eric Bledsoe's penetration, and his post game and off-ball work could be a second option with right match-ups. I see him initially fitting into Marcus Morris' role as a shooter and scorer off the bench and progressing from there.
</p>
			<p>
				It is true the Suns need more help on defense than they do on offense, but if Ryan McDonough has a chance to draft him he should do so. McDermott's ability to get buckets in an incredibly efficient way would both fit in well to Hornacek's run and shoot system and would allow Dragic and Bledsoe to do what they do best even more.

			</p>
			<p>
				McDermott is mocked in the top 10 by most places, and I doubt he falls all the way to 14. But if he does, or the Suns have a chance to move up a few shots, he would look great in purple and orange.
